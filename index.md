### CPSC 120

[Lab 12](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-12-john-ramos-and-eric-ly)
Although my reasoning for liking lab 12 is completely different from the others, I believe it has more meaning to it. In this lab I was forced to work alone because my partner ended up leaving me and working with another group and didn't let me know about it. I worked on the whole thing by myself and felt very proud at the end, as it reflected my knowledge of computer science and what we learned in regards to that lab. I also learned that even though you have your errors in coding, don't give up because eventually you will get it and understand it, and that's mostly what happened to me in this lab. I never gave up!

[Lab 8](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-08-jason-john)
I really enjoyed lab 8 because of my struggle with it. And during this lab my partner was really able to help me out alot and explain things that I didn't understand to me, and it made the whole process a lot more fun and easy. It also helped me work on my teamwork skills. Also part 3 of the lab was really cool in my opinion and made the coding process worth it in the end.

[Lab 7](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-07-john-ramos)
I love the game blackjack and i play it all the time in person, and being able to create a code to show the process of how the game works was really fun and it is one of the best parts about coding i believe. Being able to compute the score of the given list of cards was really cool and interesting because we were working not just with numbers but Letters that would equal a number value as well. Calculating dates in part 1 was also really fun to code with my partner because of the different dates you can use in order to calculate the number of days between them.
